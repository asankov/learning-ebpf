# Chapter 1: What is eBPF, and Why Is It Important?

**kprobes (kernel probes)** - a feature that allows developers to set "traps" on any instruction at the kernel code.
eBPF programs can also be attached to kprobes.

**Kernel modules** - modules that can be loaded into the Kernel independently for additional functionality.
